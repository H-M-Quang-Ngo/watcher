    The zone migration strategy no longer requires a dst_node to be passed.
    When unspecified, the Nova scheduler will select an appropriate host automatically.
    This brings the implementation of the strategy in line with the the api schema
    where dest_node is optional.

    See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/watcher/+bug/2108988 for more details.
