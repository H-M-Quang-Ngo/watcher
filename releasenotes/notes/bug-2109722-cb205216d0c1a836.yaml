    Previously, when an audit was created with zone_migration strategy and
    both storage_pools and compute_nodes parameters are passed, the audit
    did not created the required instances migration actions if any volume
    migration action was created.

    Now, in that situation the audit will create both instance and volume
    migrations according to the expected behavior and the limits defined
    by the parallelization parameters.
