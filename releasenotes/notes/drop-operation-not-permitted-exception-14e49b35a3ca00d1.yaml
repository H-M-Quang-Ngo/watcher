    Removed unused ``OperationNotPermitted`` exception that was dead code
    since the initial import of the Watcher codebase. This exception was
    not used anywhere in the REST API controllers except for preventing
    goal removal from audit templates. The functionality has been replaced
    with the standard ``wsme.exc.ClientSideError`` exception, which provides
    the appropriate 400 Bad Request response behavior.
