    The zone migration strategy no longer fails when when an audit is created
    with defined storage_pools, compute_nodes is not provided, and
    with_attached_volume is set to True.
    The strategy now creates the required volume migrations, but no instance
    migrations. Both volumes and instances will only be migrated if the audit parameters
    have both compute_nodes and storage_pools.

    See: https://bugs.launchpad.net/watcher/+bug/2111429 for more details.
