    Currently, the zone migration strategy has a ``src_type`` parameter in the ``storage_pools``
    input parameter which is ignored, even though it's required when storage_pools is defined.

    This patch makes the src_type parameter optional in the zone migration strategy, and when
    passed by the user, will use its values to filter the volumes which can be migrated.
