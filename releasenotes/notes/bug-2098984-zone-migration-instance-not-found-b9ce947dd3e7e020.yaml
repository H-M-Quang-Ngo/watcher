    Fixes a bug in the zone migration strategy where audits would fail due to
    an unhandled exception when trying to plan instance migration that exist
    in Nova but not in Watcher's compute model.
    The strategy now filters out the elements that are not found in the model,
    allowing the audit to complete successfully. For more details, please see
    `Bug #2098984 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/watcher/+bug/2098984>`_.
